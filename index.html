			<h2>About this app</h2>
			<p>I have created a 1 switch interface for the calculator application. In the entire calculator UI no elements are clickable. Only one input component is provided. This is 
				designed to mimic the one key switch interface which is used by people with disabilities to communicate with different computing devices. I have used a moving window approach
				using timers which continuously moves through different elements to enable user to select the desired number or operator. 
			</p>
			<h3>Instructions for using the app</h3>
			<p>
				In this app the Select button is the clickable component which acts as a single switch, similar to the switch in switch based interfaces. There is a moving window
				which moves constantly across rows and across elements. Initially the window moves from one row to another. Click the Select button to click to a desired row.
				Then the window moves from one element to another within that selected row. Click the Select button again to select a specific element. This way the selections of 
				operators and numbers are done using the single switch.
			</p>
			<p>In addition to a single switch interface, a 2 switch interface was also designed to compare the performance between the two. The link is given at the top of the page
				to navigate to the 2 key switch interface.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Test details
			</h3>
			<p>Two different kinds of test were performed. Firstly the speed of the moving window was varied by changing the timer value. Different values of timer
				used in this test were 500ms, 1000ms and 1500 ms.  In the second test the 1 key interface was compared with a similar window based interface
			with two keys: Select and Next. Next is used to move the window and Select is used to select that specific row or element. Comparisons were made based on the
			number of errors made and speed. Altogether 6 different expressions were used for testing. The calculator interface doesn't have a back button. So whenever user
			makes an error, he has to navigate and press the button 'C' to clear everything and start over. This whole correction time is added to the total time taken to 
			calculate that expression.</p>
			
			<h3>
				Results of tests
			</h3>
			<div>
				Following table shows the time taken to calculate the expression using different window speeds of 500ms, 1000ms, 1500 ms.

				From the above results, it can be observed that for the window speed of 500 ms faster speed can be attained. But there is a risk of making errors in this case.
				Since the window speed is fast, large number of errors occured in this method. To correct the errors, the numbers had to reentered which added a large amount of extra time.
				When errors occur the time taken for completion increases by a huge amount. In terms of number of errors it is the worst. For the speed of 1500 ms, few number of errors were
				made but the speed was very slow. In most of the cases the speed was the slowest among the three options. Also, if any errors occured then the time taken to completion was
				really long. The window speed of 1000 ms balances the speed and accuracy factor quite nicely. It is faster than the 1500 ms window speed and the number of errors were
				also low in this case. Another thing to note is that whenever error occured, it did not take a very large amount of extra time to re enter the numbers to make the correction.

			Following table shows the time taken to calculate the different expression for the 1 key switch interface and 2 key switch interface. For this experiment, the window
			speed of 1000 ms was chosen, since it was the optimal window speed given by the first test.

				The results of this test shows that the 2 key switch was faster than the 1 key interface. Navigation is comparatively quicker in the 2 key interface since there was a 
				separate button for navigation purposes. It was under the control of the user. But in 1 key switch, navigation was done by the system and user had to wait for the window
				to move into their desired location. But the 1 key interface has a much simpler interface. It is feasible to those users who find moving their hands from one button to another
				difficult. In terms of number of errors the 2 key interface is better but the number of errors is quite low for both the cases which may be due to a comfortable window speed.
